 Hi, I’m Shashank Namdev.
I’m a passionate learner who loves exploring technology in depth. I enjoy understanding how things work, mastering concepts quickly, and building solutions that make an impact. With a strong foundation in mathematics, I naturally gravitate towards fields that require logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving.
<br>

I’m currently pursuing Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at
Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya, Indore, where I’m diving deeper into algorithms, data, and intelligent systems.
<br>
Technology excites me because it never stops evolving—and neither do I. I enjoy working on complex problems that keep me fully engaged and push me to think differently. My interests expand across:
<br>
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
<br><br>
Robotics and Intelligent Automation
<br><br>
Web Development
<br><br>
App Development
<br><br>
I’m constantly learning, building, experimenting, and improving. My goal is to create innovative tech solutions and work on projects that challenge both my skills and imagination.
